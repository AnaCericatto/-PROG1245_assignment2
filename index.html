          Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, also known as Lula da Silva or simply
          <strong>Lula</strong>, is a Brazilian politician who is the
          <strong>39th and current president of Brazil</strong>. A member of the
          Workers' Party, he previously served as the 35th president of Brazil
          from 2003 to 2010. <br />
          Of working-class origin Lula migrated as a child from Pernambuco to
          São Paulo with his family. As a teenager, he began his career as a
          metalworker and became a trade unionist. During the military
          dictatorship in Brazil, he led major workers' strikes between 1978 and
          1980, and helped start the Workers' Party in 1980, during Brazil's
          political opening. Lula was one of the main leaders of the Diretas Já
          movement, which demanded democratic elections. In the 1986 Brazilian
          legislative election, he was elected as a federal deputy in the state
          of São Paulo, with the most votes nationwide. <br />
          He ran his first major campaign in the 1989 Brazilian presidential
          election, losing in the second round to Fernando Collor de Mello. He
          went on to lose two other presidential elections in 1994 and 1998 to
          Fernando Henrique Cardoso, before becoming president in the 2002
          Brazilian presidential election, in which he defeated José Serra in
          the runoff. <br />
          In 2006, he was re-elected as president, defeating Geraldo Alckmin in
          the second round.Described as left-wing, his first presidency, which
          coincided with the first pink tide in the region, was marked by the
          consolidation of social welfare programs such as Bolsa Família and
          Fome Zero, which propelled Brazil to leave the United Nations' Hunger
          Map.During his two terms in office, he undertook radical reforms in
          the country, which eventually led to growth in GDP, reduction in
          public debt and inflation, and helping 20 million Brazilians escape
          poverty.In 2006, he was re-elected as president, defeating Geraldo
          Alckmin in the second round.Described as left-wing, his first
          presidency, which coincided with the first pink

          Where there is hunger there is no hope. There is only desolation and
          pain. Hunger nurtures violence and fanaticism. A world where people
          starve will never be safe
